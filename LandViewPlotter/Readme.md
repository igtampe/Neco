The Landview Plotter is designed to make it easy to plot out Landview Items including Coutnries, Roads, Districts and Plots, and save them directly to the local, or configured Neco Database. It's also used as a testing area to ensure plots are properly checked for when they're added or edited (IE: Ensuring plots are registered in the propper district and that it does not conflict with other plots in the district).

We also tested the Landview Graphics Engine on how it can render images for every type of landview item. This testing was invaluable in creating the Neco Backend.

To learn more about Landview, take a look at the backend, common, or the data package.
