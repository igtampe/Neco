    /// </summary>

    /**Further explanation: 
     * 
     * Because of the way we parse returns as either .text() or .json(), having a usual return be an object but an error result be text can make it difficult for the body of the
     * result to be parsed correctly, even if we know there's been an error. So, to make my life a little easier, let's do this instead.
     * 
     * I'm sure there's a better way to do this but this is a relatively quick and easy fix. Plus we get to specify additional data:
     * This could probably be an anonymous type generated at error but may as well make a reusable object.
